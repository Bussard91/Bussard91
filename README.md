Hello,

my name is Jakob Adler and I am a physician with specialization in laboratory medicine.

My main interests are:

- Medical Data Science
- Statistical Learning

I´m currently working on different Shiny-Web-Apps for:
- Estimation of the Minimal Difference (MD) at a given cut-off
- Method comparison in the clinical laboratory using zlog-values
- Estimation of reference intervals from routine laboratory data using an indirect approach

If you have any questions you can contact me here on github or by mail: jakob_adler@gmx.de.

See you,
Jakob
